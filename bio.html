                <h1>Vincent's Bio</h1>
                <p>Hi I'm Vincent, a sophomore at Tufts University. 
                   I'm currently majoring in Computer Science, and 
                   I have a strong ambition to make an impact in my 
                   communities with my knowledge of computer science.
                   I discovered my passion for programming in high 
                   school and since then, I've taught myself new languages
                   and frameworks using online resources such as Udacity, 
                   Udemy, YouTube, and online blogs. I'm currently learning
                   Web Development and Data Science, and I hope to bring 
                   my ideas to life in the near future. When I'm not busy, 
                   I enjoy breakdancing, jumping into outdoor adventures 
                   and experimenting with photography.</p>
