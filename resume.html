                            Tufts University’s Data Structures course by 
                            teaching students about dynamic arrays, linked–lists,
                            hash tables, binary trees, graphs, and sorting algorithms</ul>
                        <ul>Air Force Research Laboratory Research Intern - I developed 
                            an Android Application that controlled the NAO Humanoid 
                            Robot’s arm, head, leg joints, and streamed live video 
                            to the user from the NAO’s cameras. I also researched 
                            motion tracking algorithms to control the NAO with human
                            gestures using the XBox Kinect Sensor</ul>
